"""
The sum of squares of the first ten natural is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10 ^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 +...+ 10)^2 = 55 ^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
